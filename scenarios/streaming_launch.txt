# Title
Global Streaming Launch Creative Test

# Description
The brand studio is in final rehearsals for a multi-continent streaming bundle launch. Sixteen connected TV markets beta-tested a cinematic hero spot while the same households later saw an optimized promo cut. Incremental revenue per household was tracked in both windows, letting us measure creative lift without mixing in fresh media or targeting changes.

The studio believes the lush hero spot creates halo value that justifies its spend, but the growth team suspects the promo-led edit will scale more efficiently. Use the paired data to preview the lift before the global rollout is locked.
