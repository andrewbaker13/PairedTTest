# Title
B2B Nurture Content Tracks

# Description
A conversion marketing team wants to know whether its new insight-driven nurture emails outperform the long-standing product spec series. Because both sets were sent to the same 34 in-market accounts (separated by two weeks), the analyst only has access to summary stats on the change in marketing qualified opportunities per account.

The data below reflect the mean and standard deviation of the paired differences (insights track minus legacy). Plug them into the summary mode to sanity-check the uplift story—or switch to your own CRM export if new data arrive.
