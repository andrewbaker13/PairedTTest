# Title
Retail Promotions Pricing Test

# Description
A nationwide retailer alternated its loyalty pricing banners between “Compare & Save” language and a new “Bundle Rewards” frame across 20 stores. Teams captured the basket lift (new condition minus legacy) for each store to see whether the softer framing nudged shoppers toward bigger baskets without additional discounts.

These difference scores show the incremental dollars per basket when the Bundle Rewards banners were in market. Load the preset to experiment with alternative α levels or to see how the histogram reacts to the imported CSV.
